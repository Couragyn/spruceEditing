Whenever I had a question, I was answered promptly and in courteous fashion. From start to finish, they took care of my book as if it were their own and tried to make the story the best it could be.</p>
							<p>The service provided by Daphne and Rachel was leaps and bounds above what I could’ve expected. After they finished with the beta read, I was provided with a thorough list of strengths and weaknesses they had noticed with the plot and character development, suggested changes, and various prose, spelling, and grammar areas that were lacking. The sheer detail of their review was spectacular. I definitely feel like my story has benefited greatly with this dynamic duo and if you are actively searching for an editor or beta reader, look no further!”</p>
